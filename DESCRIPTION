Description: Construction method of nested resolvable designs from 
    a projective geometry defined on Galois field of order 2. The obtained
    Resolvable designs are used to build uniform design. The presented results
    are based on <https://eudml.org/doc/219563> and A. Boudraa et al. (See references).
